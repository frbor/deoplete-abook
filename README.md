# deoplete-abook

A plugin for [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) to get abook
autocompletion functionality.

This plugin was created by looking at the implementation of [deoplete-flow](https://github.com/steelsojka/deoplete-flow).

## Installation

Currently only tested with NeoVim and Python3 client.
Check out the deoplete documentation to get the basic setup.

Install this plugin with your favourite plugin manager. With dein you can do this:

```
call dein#add('frbor/deoplete-abook', {'on_ft': "mail"})
```

Also make sure `abook` is available as it will use this command for auto completion:

```
abook --mutt-query
```

## Configuration

```
# Binary path to your abook, defaults to your $PATH flow
let g:deoplete#sources#abook#abook_bin = 'abook'
```
